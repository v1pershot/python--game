Log #1 1:37am Aug 20
that night the 8 commit was made and it added the middlefile and the main_game.py file
renamed main to start and added some code debugging ideas but nothing much.
I tried to get it so when the accounthandle module was done it would start a game but didn't have enough time to fix it 
the middle file thing just dont work so i hopefully fix tomarrow and start on the game. which btw i cant use this computer 
i have to use another one as github code space cant understand pygame. I also delted a whole bunch of depricated functions 
in the accounthandle file so happy debugging. Talk next time, cya
