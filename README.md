# python--game
This is a game where it is army vs army and you have to attack or defend the base
This game is work in progress and will hopefully have a v1 relase before thanksgiving
This game does take inspiration for the game zombsroyale.io and other shooters that have the same features
# Security 
There will be an account system and I have no plans of adding encyption to the username and passwords, so 
please don't use any real info as it will not be protected.
# Helping
If you want to help just ask me and I send the code so we can collaborate.
# Main Idea
The main idea of the game is to be able to have massive multiplayer battles. The main focus is not a battle royale 
type game, but instead I want a more team based, like 50v50, type game. There is a simple mechanic where you can place cover 
but the idea is still under development so many changes could happen.
# License
I really dont care what you do with the game as long as you give credit, if you built upon the base game and published it, plz just give some credit. Otherwise have fun trying to debug my code
